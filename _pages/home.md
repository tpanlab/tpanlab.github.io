### About the Lab

The Pan Lab at the Biomedical Informatics Department at Emory focuses on developing data science methods to enable large scale biomedical and bioinformatic studies, through flexible and extensible data management, high performance computing (HPC) approaches, and efficient sequential and parallel algorithms and implementations, particularly for image, genomic and transcriptomic, and waveform data analyses.
